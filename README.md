# Multi-Label-Co-regularization-for-Semi-supervised-Facial-Action-Unit-Recognition

Here is the reproducibility challenge of Multi-Label-Co-regularization-for-Semi-supervised-Facial-Action-Unit-Recognition [1].

The Loss, Net, Train and Test module are all packaged in multi_label_co_regularization.ipynb. Use it to train and test the model.
